details: 'You can verify NPM token using npm (replacing 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 with NPM token):
Refer: https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/one-token-to-leak-them-all-the-story-of-a-8000-npm-token-79b13af182a3

export NPM_TOKEN="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}" > .npmrc
npm whoami
Another way to verify token is to query API directly:

curl -H ''authorization: Bearer 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'' ''https://registry.npmjs.org/-/whoami''
You''ll get username in response in case of success, 401 Unauthorized in case if token doesn''t exists and 403 Forbidden in case if your IP address is not whitelisted.

NPM token can be CIDR-whitelisted. Thus if you are using token from non-whitelisted CIDR you''ll get 403 Forbidden in response. So try to verify NPM token from different IP ranges!.

P.S. Some companies uses registries other than registry.npmjs.org. If it''s the case replace all registry.npmjs.org occurrences with domain name of company''s NPM registry.
